# Steps
# Step 1:

Create a S3 bucket just by giving a name,
while giving the name don't forget that you have to give a unique name.(As every bucket is uniquely named on AWS)
just leave every option default
And create the bucket

# Step 2:
 Go to properties of the bucket
 At the bottom we can find the option to enable hosting of static website
 By default it is disabled
 we have to enable it inorder to host our website by entering the html file name.

# Step 3:
 Now we get an url of the bucket.
 we can find that it is not working.
 Because we have not uploaded the html file and have not given necessary permissions to the bucket.
 Let us give the permissions to the bucket by attaching the policy.

 Also by default public access is not allowed for the bucket we have to change it.

Our Website is successfully hosted !!
We can access our website
